/* 
The new guy in your team wrote this terrible code
and now he's asking you why it doesn't work...

He's telling you the specs are:
    - the function receives an array (of integers) or null.
    - the function should return the minimum and maximum values (of the given array)
    - the return value should also be an array, i.e: [min, max]

Example 1:
Array: [4, 6, 35, -65, -9, 0, 67]
Result: [-65, 67]

Example 2:
Array: [-30, 5, 43, 108, -5, -7, 89]
Result: [-30, 108]

Example 3:
Array: [56, 7, 63, 9, 7, 12, 85]
Result: [7, 85]

Fix the following function to help your new coworker!

Note: try changing only the necessary code, don't rewrite the entire thing.

let arrayTest = [-30, 5, 43, 108, -5, -7, 89]


const minMax = (array) => {
    let arr = []
    let min = Math.min(...array)
    let max = Math.max(...array)
    arr.push(`${min}, ${max}`)
    return arr
}
console.log(minMax(arrayTest))
